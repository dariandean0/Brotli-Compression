In the beginning, there was nothing but darkness and silence. The universe existed
in a state of perfect equilibrium, neither expanding nor contracting, neither hot
nor cold. Time itself had no meaning, for there were no events to mark its passage.

Then, in an instant that defied comprehension, everything changed. A singularity of
infinite density and temperature burst forth in what scientists would later call the
Big Bang. Space and time began their cosmic dance, stretching and warping as matter
and energy flooded into existence.

In those first fractions of a second, the fundamental forces of nature separated from
their unified origin. Quarks combined to form protons and neutrons, which would later
become the building blocks of atoms. As the universe expanded and cooled, these
particles came together to form the first atomic nuclei.

Hundreds of thousands of years passed before the universe became transparent to light.
Electrons finally joined with nuclei to create neutral atoms, allowing photons to
travel freely through space for the first time. This ancient light still surrounds us
today as the cosmic microwave background radiation.

Gravity worked tirelessly to pull matter together into ever-denser clumps. The first
stars ignited, fusion reactions burning hydrogen into helium and releasing tremendous
amounts of energy. These early stellar furnaces forged the heavier elements that would
become essential for life.
