# Brotli-Compression
CSE 4081 - Data Compression Group Project
Team: Vincenzo Barager, Darian Dean, Elton Batista

This project is an implementation of the Brotli compression algorithm in Python from scratch.

The (current) skeleton is two files, compress.py and decompress.py. compress.py takes an input file and produces a compressed output file and decompress.py will decompress the file into its original form (lossless).
